##Development Guidelines

#####How will progress on the project be tracked?
Progress will be tracked by github commits and email messages.

#####How will the work be broken down into units and assigned to team members?
Work will be broken down based on team member strengths. Team members will decide what they are able/prefer to do.

#####What will be the structure of the Git repo? What are the rules for branching and committing?
Only working code is allowed to be committed. The git repository will contain a master. Everybody should develop on their own 
branch, pulling and pushing to/from master before and after a development session.

#####What is the standard for testing? Do you require code coverage metrics, if so, what?
Testing will be broken down into modules that test specific game functions. Full service testing is impossible, so QA user testing will be a large part of testing.

#####What documentation must be provided?
Complex functionality will be fully documented, Game system and instructions will be documented.

#####How will the team track bugs?
Bugs will be documented on GitHub with information on the issue: symptoms, and likely reason for occurrance, and how to reproduce.

#####What are the coding standards?
Complex functions will be commented. Classes will be commented at top of files.
